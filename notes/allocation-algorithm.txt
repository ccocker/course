Allocation Algorithm
Allocate tutors to classes preferencing existing tutors over new tutors.
Allocate tutors to classes by preference, day, and non consecutive allocations.

1. Create a list of all preferences.
2. Sort all preferences by tutor (existing then preference count) in ascending order
3. Sort all tutors preferences in ascending order and grouped by day
4. Create list of allocations.
   4a. REPEAT UNTIL all preferences have been added.
       i. FOR EACH tutor.
            Get next preference.
            Check if next preference is non consecutive.
            If non consecutive then add to allocation and remove preference.
            Else remove preference.
5. Process all allocations.
